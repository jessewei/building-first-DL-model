Typically, it consists of an input layer that takes in the features, a number of hidden layers (more layer -> deep NN), and an oputput layer that returns the prediction. The layers in the NN are are composed of Neurons (aka Perceptrons), which are essentially a mathematical function in the from of `y = Wx + b` where W is the weight and b is the biase. Also, typically the output of a perceptron is passed to an [activation function which normalizes the result](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function). \n\nA CNN is basically a NN with one or more of its hidden layers, typically first, being a [Convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution). This allows the NN to extract features from input such as images.\n\n![NN](https://i.imgur.com/xPMkf4i.png)\n\n```\nBaced on 'A deep MNIST classifier using convolutional layers'.\nSee extensive documentation at\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/pros\n```\n"
